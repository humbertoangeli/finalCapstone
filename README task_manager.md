# task_manager.py

## This program is a capstone of the Hyperion BootCamp. It is a task manager with options for creating a task and editing with user control. Both users and tasks are recorded in a text file.

This program consolidates many of the techniques learned in BootCamp, from defensive programming, code blocks, file and variable manipulation, and data structure management.
